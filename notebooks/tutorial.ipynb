    "1. **Functors are composable**: You can apply multiple functors to get a multi-dimensional view of narrative structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure is measurable**: The Harmon Circle and Kishōtenketsu detectors provide quantitative conformance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cultural patterns differ**: Western narratives tend toward descent-ascent (valley) shapes, while Eastern narratives often show plateau-spike-resolution patterns.\n",
